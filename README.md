# AO3 Wrapped
Lightweight web application inspired by Spotify Wrapped that utilizes web scraping to generate user statistics and data visualizations from popular online creative writing platform Archive of Our Own (AO3).

You can check it out (and get your own Wrapped) [here](https://ao3wrapped.lol)!

## About
I've always been a nerdy kid at heart, and while I love checking my Spotify Wrapped stats at the end of every year, I always wished I could get the stats for the fanfiction I read too. After all, I spend a lot more time reading than I do streaming music. Before this project, I would generate my stats by using a web scraping Google Chrome extension, sending my data to Google Sheets as a CSV, and manually creating my own graphs and charts from there. However, I wanted an easier and more user-friendly way to generate my reading stats, and that's how AO3 Wrapped was born!

AO3 Wrapped will show you:
- 🫂 Total word count read
- 💌 Top ships and fandoms
- 🗣️ Character that showed up most frequently
- 💑 Most common relationship category
- ⚠️ Age rating breakdown
- 💭 Word cloud of your most frequented tags
- 📅 The month you read the most

This was the first full project I've ever built, and while there are definitely areas I can improve on, I did learn a lot. AO3 Wrapped taught me how to build web applications from start to finish—both front-end and back-end—and how to deploy them using EC2 instances. I may come back to it in the near future to clean up some code and/or add more features, but for now, take it as my love letter to fannish culture and computer programming, and maybe get your own Wrapped while you're at it. 😊
